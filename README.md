Task: AI CHATBOT WITH NLP

This is a beginner-level chatbot project developed as part of an internship task. The chatbot is designed to answer basic questions about *famous places, **famous people, **animals, and **colors*. It responds with short informative facts and follows up with additional related details if the user wants to know more.

### Tools and Platform Used:
- *Platform*: Windows (Command Line Interface)
- *Language*: Python
- *Editor*: Visual Studio Code / Notepad++ (or any preferred Python editor)

### Libraries Used:
- *NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)*: Used for tokenizing and lemmatizing the input text.
  - punkt: For splitting the user input into tokens.
  - wordnet: For lemmatization to reduce words to their base form.
- *random*: To give slightly varied responses and make the chatbot more interactive.

### Project Overview:
The chatbot starts by welcoming the user and can recognize simple greetings. It asks users to choose from predefined categories (places, people, animals, and colors). Once a category or specific item is mentioned, it responds with relevant information and follows up with related options like culture, food, traits, achievements, etc.

It also handles unrecognized inputs by giving fallback replies, encouraging the user to try again with a different question.

The chatbot uses a simple rule-based system and maintains the context of the last topic discussed to allow follow-up questions.
